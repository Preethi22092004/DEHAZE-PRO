# Dehazing System Update Guide

## What's New
Our dehazing system has been updated to fix an issue that was causing processed images to have an unnatural red tint. The system now produces properly color-balanced dehazed images with natural appearance.

## Changes You'll Notice
- Properly dehazed images without red tint
- More natural color reproduction
- Better detail preservation in dark areas
- Improved overall quality of dehazed images and videos

## Using the Updated System

### Web Application
The web application has been updated automatically. Simply upload your hazy images or videos as before, and you'll get properly dehazed results.

### Options for Different Needs:
1. **AOD-Net Model**: Fast dehazing with good quality
2. **Enhanced Model**: Higher quality dehazing with more detail preservation
3. **Light Model**: Balanced approach between speed and quality
4. **CLAHE Method**: Very fast non-ML method for quick enhancements

### API Usage
If you're using our API, no changes are needed on your end. The improvements have been implemented server-side.

## Troubleshooting
If you still encounter any issues with image quality or color balance:
1. Make sure you're using the latest version of the application
2. Try regenerating the model weights using the provided script:
   ```
   python regenerate_weights.py
   ```
3. Contact our support team if issues persist
